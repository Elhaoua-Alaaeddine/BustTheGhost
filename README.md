# Bust The Ghost

<h2>About the Game</h2>
<p>"Bust The Ghost" is an interactive, strategy-based game that challenges players to use deductive reasoning and hints to locate a hidden ghost. The game utilizes Bayesian inference principles to provide clues and engage players in a hunt for the ghost using logic and probabilistic reasoning.</p>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>The game is set on a grid, each cell potentially holding a clue to the ghost's whereabouts. Each turn, players can choose to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Peep:</strong> Reveal the probabilities on the cells; each probability indicates how likely it is for the ghost to be there.</li>
  <li><strong>Bust:</strong> If you believe you've found the ghost's location, attempt to bust it! Be cautious; you only have 2 bust attempts. If both bust attempts are wrong then you lose, and if you bust the ghost you win.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clues are represented through a color-coded system, indicating the distance from the ghost's presence. Utilize these clues strategically to narrow down and ultimately pinpoint the ghost's location.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Interactive Gameplay:</strong> Engage with a dynamic grid system that responds to your every action.</li>
  <li><strong>Probabilistic Puzzles:</strong> Apply Bayesian reasoning to deduce the ghost's location with the clues provided.</li>
  <li><strong>Scoring System:</strong> Keep track of your deductive prowess with a scoring system that rewards insightful guesses and penalizes hasty mistakes.</li>
</ul>
